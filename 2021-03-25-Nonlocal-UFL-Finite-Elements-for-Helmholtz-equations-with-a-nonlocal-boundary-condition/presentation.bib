abstract = {A new technique of free-space simulation has been developed for solving unbounded electromagnetic problems with the finite-difference time-domain method. Referred to as PML, the new technique is based on the use of an absorbing layer especially designed to absorb without reflection the electromagnetic waves. The first part of the paper presents the theory of the PML technique. The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation. These comparisons show that the PML technique works better than the others in all cases; using it allows us to obtain a higher accuracy in some problems and a release of computational requirements in some others.}

abstract = {Abstract The paper introduces the sweeping preconditioner, which is highly efficient for iterative solutions of the variable-coefficient Helmholtz equation including very-high-frequency problems. The first central idea of this novel approach is to construct an approximate factorization of the discretized Helmholtz equation by sweeping the domain layer by layer, starting from an absorbing layer or boundary condition. Given this specific order of factorization, the second central idea is to represent the intermediate matrices in the hierarchical matrix framework. In two dimensions, both the construction and the application of the preconditioners are of linear complexity. The generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) solver with the resulting preconditioner converges in an amazingly small number of iterations, which is essentially independent of the number of unknowns. This approach is also extended to the three-dimensional case with some success. Numerical results are provided in both two and three dimensions to demonstrate the efficiency of this new approach. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The method consists of an outer and inner iteration process. The inner iteration is used to approximately solve a preconditioner, which in this case is based on a modified PML equation. The outer iteration is a Krylov subspace method (Bi-CGSTAB). The method explained here is identical with the method already discussed and proposed, e.g., in [Erlangga, Oosterlee, Vuik, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 27 (2006), pp. 1471-1492]. We show that the extension of the method to the PML equation is straight-forward, and the performance for this type of problem does not degrade as compared to Helmholtz problems with, e.g. Engquist and Majda’s second order boundary condition.}, author={Erlangga, Y.
