Thanks to Dr. Markus Hunziker for the book recommendation, and to
William Dunham, whose chapter {\it Cardano and the Solution of the
Cubic} in the book {\it Journey through Genius} provided the primary
source for this talk.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Solving for $x$}
\begin{block}{Linear Equation}
\begin{equation}
    mx + b = 0
\end{equation}
\end{block}
i.e., solve equations that look like this (easy): 
\begin{equation*}
    3x + 2 = 0,\qquad
    x - 5 = 0,\qquad
    42 x - 123456789 =0 
\end{equation*}

\uncover<2->{
    \begin{block}{Quadratic Equation}
    \begin{equation}
        ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    \end{equation}
    \end{block}
    i.e., solve equations that look like this (only a little harder): 
    \begin{equation*}
        2x^2+3x + 2 = 0,\qquad
        4x^2+x - 5 = 0,\qquad
        -123x^2+42 x - 123456789 =0 
    \end{equation*}

What's the natural next equation to solve? \emph{The cubic:}
\begin{block}{Cubic Equation}
\begin{equation}
    ax^3 + bx^2+cx+d = 0
\end{equation}
\end{block}
i.e., solve equations that look like this (hard): 
\begin{eqnarray*}
    4x^3-2x^3+3x + 2 = 0,\\
    100x^3 + x - 5 = 0,\\
    42x^3 - 21x^2+42 x - 123456789 =0

\frametitle{{\it Summa de Arithmetica}}

\begin{columns}[c]
\column{.45\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Luca Pacioli (1494)}
    In a contemporary mathematics textbook, Pacioli assesses solving the cubic
    equation as impossible as ``squaring the circle", a problem posed by
    the ancient Greeks (and proven impossible in the 1800s).

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    This all changed, when Scipione del Ferro solves the ``repressed cubic:"
    \begin{equation*}
        x^3 + mx = n
    \end{equation*}
    \item
    But, he kept the solution secret.
    \item On his deathbed in 1526, del Ferro tells his student, Antonio
    Fior
    \item A hothead, Fior challenges a noted scholar--Niccolo Fontana

    \item
    Niccolo Fontana, better known as ``Tartaglia" (meaning ``the
    Stammerer", due to a war wound).

    \item
    Fontana had boasted he could solve cubics of another form.

\begin{block}{The Challenge}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Fior gives Tartaglia 30 ``repressed cubics", Tartaglia gave Fior 30
    problems of various topics.

    \item
    Working furiously, Tartaglia discovers the solution the night before
    the problems are due, winning 30 to 0.

    \item 
    Fior fades from history.

    Now enters the strangest character of the story--Gerolamo Cardano

    received a good omen (the incessant squawking of a magpie)

    a near equal
